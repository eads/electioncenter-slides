* __Sideways guy__: Some strange EXIF data apparently told Pillow to rotate one candidate's photo 90 degrees.
* __Stop the presses__: Due to an administrative error on the part of a precinct, we made a last minute correction to all the statewide races right before a print deadline.
* __Get rid of these candidates__: Thinking I could easily remove candidates from our source data, I broke the spreadsheet the reporters were working on for a few minutes and caused a fair panic.
