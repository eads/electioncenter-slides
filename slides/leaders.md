## Choose your leaders 

<p style="font-size: .95em; line-height: 1.6em; text-align: left;">
Choose your leaders with wisdom and forethought.<br/>
To be led by a coward is to be controlled by all that the coward fears.<br/>
To be led by a fool is to be led by the opportunists who control the fool.<br/>
To be led by a thief is to offer up your most precious treasures to be stolen.<br>
To be led by a liar is to ask to be told lies.<br/>
To be led by a tyrant is to sell yourself and those you love into slavery.
</p>
